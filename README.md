## My skills and passions üöÄ

Even though I'm still a student, I have a lot of experience in software development, mainly thanks to the fact that I'm
an inquisitive person, and I'm very passionate about what I do.
Plus, I‚Äôm a rapid learner, and I'm always looking for new things to learn and new challenges.
My experience ranges from frontend development to backend development, and I've also worked with databases, container
applications, and I know how to deal with Linux and Windows servers management and configuration.

My very first approach to CS was when I was 9, and I started learning JavaScript and, since then, I've matured a lot of
experience with contributions to little private projects and big public ones.
I moved from JavaScript to TypeScript (which was my main language for a very long time),
then I started learning Java, which opened me the doors to the JVM-compatible languages world.
After that, I started learning Kotlin, which is now my favorite language, and the one I've worked with most (well...
_excluding JS and TS of course_).

I've also had a fair share of experience with C# and Rust, and I'm currently learning how to use them properly.

A new passion of mine is malware analysis and reverse engineering, and I'm currently studying it in my free time, and
hope to be able to create something in that matter in the future.

Following this, you will find an extensive list of the languages, frameworks, tools and technologies I've worked with during the past years in the form of a Kotlin data class.
I find this to be a unique way to show off my skills, and it's also a way to show my love for Kotlin.

## My overview üìù

A textual version is available [here](/README.old.md).
This is Kotlin code that you can run [here](https://pl.kotl.in/ywOy0eZE1), or you can read it!
